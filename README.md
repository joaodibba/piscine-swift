# Piscine Swift

## Goal

This is a hands-on tour of Swift by doing small exercises that highlight the language’s specialties and the places it differs from other languages.

## Modules

- [Module 00: Syntax and types](00/00.md)
- [Module 01: Optionals](01/01.md)
- [Module 02: Value semantics](02/02.md)
- [Module 03: Protocols](03/03.md)
- [Module 04: Extensions](04/04.md)
- [Module 05: Enums](05/05.md)
- [Module 06: Error handling](06/06.md)
- [Module 07: ARC](07/07.md)
- [Module 08: Closures](08/08.md)
- [Module 09: SwiftUI](09/09.md)


- Each module is a short set of exercises with brief context.
- The exercises are prompts, not “one correct answer”. Be creative with your solutions: add small extras (more test cases, extra helper functions/types, alternative implementations) as long as you keep the core constraints of the exercise.
